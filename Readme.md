# PlantUML

PlantUML is an open-source diagramming tool that allows **blind and visually impaired users** to create visual representations of software systems, processes, and concepts using a simple syntax and a wide range of pre-defined templates.

- [tutorial](tutorial/tutorial.md)
  **Key Features:**

1. **Easy-to-learn syntax**: PlantUML uses a simple and intuitive syntax, making it easy for developers, designers, and non-technical stakeholders to create diagrams without extensive knowledge of diagramming
   tools.
2. **Pre-defined templates**: PlantUML comes with a wide range of pre-defined templates, allowing users to quickly create diagrams for various software development concepts, such as class diagrams, sequence
   diagrams, state machines, and more.
3. **Automatic rendering**: PlantUML generates visual diagrams in multiple formats, including images (PNG, SVG, JPEG), HTML, and PDF.
4. **Integrations**: PlantUML integrates with popular IDEs, version control systems, and project management tools, making it easy to incorporate into existing workflows.
5. **Collaboration**: PlantUML allows real-time collaboration on diagrams, enabling multiple users to work together on the same diagram simultaneously.

**Types of Diagrams:**

1. **Class Diagrams**: Representing class relationships, inheritance, and interfaces.
2. **Sequence Diagrams**: Showing interactions between objects over time.
3. **State Machine Diagrams**: Visualizing state transitions and behaviors.
4. **Component Diagrams**: Representing system components and their relationships.
5. **Deployment Diagrams**: Showcasing system deployment and infrastructure.

**Benefits:**

1. **Improved communication**: PlantUML helps bridge the gap between developers, designers, and stakeholders by providing a shared visual language for discussing software systems.
2. **Reduced misunderstandings**: By using visual diagrams, misunderstandings caused by misinterpretation of code or documentation are minimized.
3. **Faster development**: PlantUML saves time by allowing users to quickly create and communicate about system designs.

**Community:**

PlantUML has an active community of users, developers, and contributors who share knowledge, examples, and templates on various platforms, including:

1. GitHub (official repository) [PlantUML GitHub Repository](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml?tab=readme-ov-file)
2. PlantUML [PlantUML Sitemap](https://plantuml.com/de/sitemap)
3. PlantUML forums [Visit the PlantUML Forum](https://forum.plantuml.net)

Overall, PlantUML is a powerful tool for creating visual representations of software systems, processes, and concepts, making it an excellent choice for developers, designers, and stakeholders alike.

# How to Install PlantUML

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing PlantUML, ensure the following requirements are met:

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: PlantUML requires Java to run.
  - To check if Java is installed, run:
    ```bash
    java -version
    ```
  - If not installed, download Java from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/).

---

## 2. Installation Methods

### A. Install the Standalone PlantUML Jar

1. **Download PlantUML**:
   - Get the PlantUML `.jar` file from the [official website](https://plantuml.com/download).
2. **Run PlantUML**:
   - Use the following command:
     ```bash
     java -jar plantuml.jar your-diagram-file.puml
     ```
   - Replace `your-diagram-file.puml` with the path to your `.puml` file.
3. **Optional**:
   - Install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/) if your diagrams require advanced layouts.

---

### B. Install Using a Package Manager

#### For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install plantuml
```

#### For Mac (Homebrew):

```bash
brew install plantuml
```

### C. Integration with Editors and IDEs

#### 1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

- Install the **PlantUML Extension** from the Extensions Marketplace.
- Ensure **Java** is installed on your system.
- Use the shortcut `Alt + D` to preview diagrams in real-time.

#### 2. IntelliJ IDEA:

- Install the **PlantUML Integration** plugin from the JetBrains Marketplace.
- Configure the plugin to use the **PlantUML .jar** file.
